# Log everything that did not match any other rules
# To skip logging for some packets, '--insert' rules above this rule which
# REJECT the traffic that should not be logged.  Use '--reject-with tcp-reset'
# for TCP packets per the comments below.

# Reject everything that did not match any other rules
# TCP packets are rejected with TCP RST rather than ICMP Port Unreachable
# because that is what Linux does by default when a TCP port is unused and
# iptables is not blocking it.  (This makes it harder for an attacker to
# distinguish between ports blocked by iptables and ports that are not blocked
# but are not currently being listened on.)
